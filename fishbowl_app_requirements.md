# Fishbowl PWA Requirements

## Overview

- The frontend of the app is a **React-based Progressive Web App (PWA)**.
- The backend should be implemented using **Express.js (Node.js)**.

## Project Structure
- `/frontend` - React PWA application
- `/backend` - Express.js server with Socket.IO
- `/database` - SQLite database schema and migrations

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React 18+, TypeScript, PWA features (service worker, manifest)
- Backend: Express.js, Socket.IO, TypeScript
- Database: SQLite
- State Management: Redux Toolkit
- UI Framework: Material-UI, Chakra UI, or Tailwind CSS

## Real-time Events

### Client-to-Server Events (Socket.IO)
- `join-gameroom` - Player joins game room for real-time updates
- `leave-gameroom` - Player leaves game room
- `assigned-team` - Broadcast team assignment changes
- `reconnect-session` - Reconnect with existing device session
- `ping` - Heartbeat/connection monitoring with device session update
- `disconnect` - Auto-triggered on connection loss

### Server-to-Client Events (Socket.IO)
- `gameroom-joined` - Confirms player joined game room
- `player-connected` - Notifies when player connects to game
- `player-disconnected` - Notifies when player disconnects from game
- `current-game-state` - Sends full game state to newly connected player
- `game-state-updated` - Broadcasts game state changes (status, round, team, timer)
- `phrase-submission-updated` - Broadcasts phrase submission progress
- `player-updated` - Broadcasts player-specific updates
- `team-assignment-updated` - Broadcasts team assignment changes
- `game:started` - Notifies when game starts
- `connection-replaced` - Notifies when connection is replaced by new device
- `session-reconnected` - Response to device session reconnection attempt
- `device-id-generated` - Returns newly generated device ID
- `pong` - Response to ping heartbeat
- `error` - Error messages for failed operations

## Backend Responsibilities

- Serve static files from the React PWA build.
- **REST API handles all persistent data operations**:
  - Game creation and setup
  - Player and team management  
  - Phrase submission and retrieval
  - Game state updates (e.g., score tracking, turn progression)
  - All database changes except player connection status
- **Socket.IO handles real-time communication**:
  - Player connection/disconnection tracking (updates `is_connected` status in database)
  - Broadcast real-time updates to all connected devices when game state changes
  - Synchronize game state across all connected devices
  - Device session management and reconnection handling
  - Real-time notifications (player joined, phrase guessed, turn started, etc.)

## Frontend Client Integration

- The React frontend will implement a **single unified game service module** that handles both REST API and Socket.IO communication
- This module will provide a simple interface for all game functions (e.g., `joinGame()`, `submitPhrase()`, `startTurn()`)
- For each game action, the module will:
  1. Make the appropriate REST API call to update persistent data
  2. Make the corresponding Socket.IO call for real-time connection/notification
  3. Return combined data from both calls to the React components
- Example: When calling `gameService.joinGame(gameCode, playerName)`:
  - Calls REST API `POST /api/games/:gameCode/join` to add player to database
  - Calls Socket.IO `join-gameroom` event to join real-time room and update connection status
  - Returns player data from REST API plus real-time connection confirmation

## Database

- Use **SQLite** to store all persistent game data, including:
  - Players and teams
  - Phrases
  - Game sessions and metadata
  - Turn history and scores
- SQLite is chosen for its **simplicity and minimal setup**:
  - It runs as a local file-based database
  - No external database server is required

## Deployment

- The **Express backend and SQLite database will run on the same server as the React PWA frontend**.
- This setup simplifies deployment and allows the app to be self-contained on a single host.
- The backend must support:
  - Real-time synchronization across devices
  - Graceful reconnection and state recovery
  - Low-latency communication between clients

## Multi-Device & Multi-User Support
- The game supports **multiple devices connected simultaneously**, with real-time synchronization of game state across all devices.
- Each device can support **one or more users**. For example:
  - A single device can have multiple players logged in (e.g., 4 players on one tablet).
  - Multiple devices can connect for the same game session (e.g., 5 devices, each with 1 or more players).
- The app supports flexible team/player configurations, such as:
  - 3 teams with 4 players each (12 players total).
  - Any combination of players spread across any number of devices (1 device to 12 devices).
- Actions that control game flow‚Äîsuch as **starting a round, beginning a player's turn**-can be initiated from **any connected device**.
- Actions that control turn flow such as **marking guesses, or skipping phrases**-can only be initiated by device that started the round
- The controlling device for the current round will be the ONLY device to show what phrase/word is currently being guessed
- All connected devices will **update in real-time** to reflect the current game state, including:
  - Current round and turn information
  - Active player and team
  - Timer countdown
  - Guessed and remaining phrases
  - Scores and progress
- The app should handle connection and disconnection gracefully, ensuring that devices joining mid-game sync to the current state.

## Device Connection & Session Management
- Each device gets a unique device_id on first connection
- If device disconnects, maintain all game state
- On reconnection, restore device to current correct game state
- Show connection status indicator on UI

# Fishbowl Mobile App Requirements & UI Design

## üìã Functional Requirements

### 1. Game Setup
- Create a game and share/join via link or code or qr code
- Game creator sets 
    - Number of teams (default 2, min 2, max 5)
    - Number of words/phrases per player (default to 3, min 1, max 10)
    - Time for each turn (default 1 min, min 10 seconds, max 5 mins) 
- Add player names
- Each player submits the configured amount of words/phrases

### 2. Game Rounds (reference Fishbowl Game Rules section for rules of the game)
- The game consists of 3 rounds, each with slightly different rules.
- Round 1 begins with a randomly selected player from a randomly selected team.
- Turns then rotate in a "circular draft" fashion:
    Example with 3 teams (A, B, C) with 2 players each:
    - Round starts: A1 ‚Üí B1 ‚Üí C1 ‚Üí A2 ‚Üí B2 ‚Üí C2 ‚Üí A1 ‚Üí B1...
    - This order continues until all phrases are guessed
    - Same order preserved across all 3 rounds
- After the current player's turn ends, the next player from the next team takes their turn.
- Teams alternate turns, with players taking turns in order within their team.
- Once all players from all teams have taken a turn, the rotation continues from the next player in the original starting order.
- This cycle repeats until all phrases in the bowl have been guessed for the current round.
- The same player order is preserved across Rounds 2 and 3.

### 2.1 List of rounds
- Round 1: Taboo-style
- Round 2: Charades (no words)
- Round 3: Password (one word)

### 2.2 Each Round
- Track and display which team and which player is up
- Track and display team score per round and cumulative
- Show list of guessed and remaining phrases per round
- A round continues until all words/phrases in the bowl have been guessed.

### 3. In-Game Turn Flow
- When a player starts their turn, their device becomes the "controlling device"
- Only the controlling device can see the current phrase
- Only the controlling device can mark phrases as guessed or skip
- All other devices see a waiting screen with timer and score updates
- When turn ends, control is released
- "Start Turn" button begins timer (configured in game setup) and shows prompt
- Buttons for "Guessed Correctly" and "Skip"
- On timeout pass to next team/player
- If all phrases/words run out the round ends
- On round end, show game summary and button to start the next round

### 4. Post-Game
- Display final scores and winning team
- Option to replay with same players, or to balance teams based on which players got the most points
- Share results (optional)

# üéâ Fishbowl Game Rules

Fishbowl is a fun party game that combines elements of **Charades**, **Taboo**, and **Password**. It's great for medium to large groups and is played in three rounds using the same set of clues.

---

## üé≤ What You Need:
- Small slips of paper or index cards
- Pens
- A bowl (the "fishbowl")
- Timer (e.g., phone or stopwatch)

---

## üë• Setup:
1. **Split into two teams**.
2. Each player writes **3‚Äì5 words or phrases** on slips of paper (inside jokes, celebrities, movie titles, random objects ‚Äî anything!)
3. All slips go into the bowl and get shuffled.

---

## üß† Objective:
Get your team to guess as many words as possible per turn. The team with the most total points after all three rounds wins.

---

## üïπÔ∏è The Three Rounds:

### Round 1: Taboo
- You can say **anything** *except* the word or a variation of it.
- Use descriptions, stories, rhymes, etc.
- No acting.
- 1-minute timer per turn.
- Skip if stuck.

**Example:** For ‚ÄúToothbrush,‚Äù you might say: ‚ÄúYou use it every morning and night on your teeth.‚Äù

### Round 2: Charades
- **No talking** at all.
- Act out the word/phrase.
- 1-minute timer per turn.
- You‚Äôre using the same words from Round 1.

### Round 3: Password
- Say **only one word** to describe the word/phrase.
- Your team gets one guess.
- 1-minute timer per turn.

**Example:** For ‚ÄúToothbrush,‚Äù you might just say: ‚ÄúBristles.‚Äù

---

## üîÅ How It Flows:
- Teams take turns sending up one person at a time as the clue-giver.
- Continue until all slips are guessed in a round.
- After each round, return all slips to the bowl and reshuffle.
- Keep score of how many each team gets per round.

---

## üîö End of Game:
Add up all three rounds‚Äô points per team. Highest total wins!

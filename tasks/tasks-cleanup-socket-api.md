## Relevant Files

- `backend/src/sockets/SOCKET-API.ts` - Main Socket.IO API implementation that needs cleanup and consolidation
- `backend/src/sockets/deviceSessionManager.ts` - Device session management functionality used by Socket API  
- `backend/unittests/sockets/SOCKET-API.test.ts` - Unit tests for Socket API that need updating after cleanup
- `backend/unittests/sockets/deviceSessionManager.test.ts` - Unit tests for device session manager (may need creation)
- `backend/docs/socket-api/README.md` - Documentation for cleaned up Socket API (needs creation)
- `backend/docs/socket-api/events-reference.md` - Reference documentation for Socket events (needs creation)

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed in `unittests` mirroring the path to the code files they are testing (e.g., `src/sockets/SOCKET-API.ts` and `unittests/sockets/SOCKET-API.test.ts`).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Analyze Current Socket API for Redundancies and Inefficiencies
  - [x] 1.1 Audit all client-to-server event handlers for overlap and redundancy
  - [x] 1.2 Audit all server-to-client events for duplicate functionality
  - [x] 1.3 Map out actual usage patterns of each event in the codebase
  - [x] 1.4 Identify events that may be candidates for removal or consolidation
  - [x] 1.5 Document current event flow and dependencies between events  
  - [x] 1.6 Analyze device session management integration points for optimization
